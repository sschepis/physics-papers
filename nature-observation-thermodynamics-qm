# The Nature of Observation, Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics

## Introduction

### The Human Observer and the Observer of Quantum Mechanics

### The Relationship between Observation, Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics
 
The following model of observation is based on a radically literalist interpretation of observable phenomena, paired with a methodology of logical deduction which uses observational equivalence* as the means of inference from statement to statement. 

The human conscious observer and the observer of Quantum Mechanics are observationally equivalent, because in both cases an unobserved object can only be modeled in probabilistic terms, and because in both cases the resulting descriptive math is identical, the two are equivalent. 

This allows us to make inferences using a human observer in a way which is mathematically valid and clearly and empirically definable using fundamental physical laws.


## The Nature of Observation

### Entropy and the Unobserved System

### The Fundamental Transformation of Measurement

### The Entropy Exchange

### The Directionality of Time

An observer only observes entropy in an observed system when that system is visible to the observer. 

When that system is invisible to the observer, it is still known to exist, but can only be modeled using the mathematics of quantum mechanics and probability. 

However, since entropy is unobservable in quantum states until those states are collapsed to specificity, the observer cannot observe entropy in that system using the means of quantum mechanics until its wave function is collapsed down to a single value.

Therefore, if entropy is measurable in an observed system, but not in an unobserved system, it is logical to state that this is because the observer is putting it there. This shows that the observer is the source of the determinism observed in their environment.

The fundamental transformation performed by an observer is measurement — the act of determining the exact state of an object for the purposes of exactly relating that object’s state to a set of other fixed states. 

Therefore it is logical that it is measurement — namely, the act of interaction performed by the observer by means of the method of observation – which acts to create the determinism the observer sees.

Because the observer exists in a closed system, by performing the activity of observation, the observer concentrates its own state to a point of low entropy as it radiates entropy outward in the light-cone of its observation. 

Because of this, the observer always  exists in a state of lower entropy than their environment, or else they would not be able to observe anything. This theory predicts that all observers exist in a state of entropy lower than their observables, whether the observer is human or a particle.

Furthermore, the act of observation must function as an exchange of entropy between the observer and the observable, radiating entropy outwards while concentrating all observers to a point, requiring all observers to be present in a specific locality and in a specific state at all times. 

The act of observation and the exchange of entropy are equivalent to a circuit where the observer is the source of energy, and the observable is a resistor. 

The exchange of entropy between them creates an oscillation in which entropy flows from one to another, creating a feedback loop that allows for information transfer. This is observed as impedance by and heating of the observed object. 

Information only flows when the observer is in a state of lower entropy than their environment, and when they are able to interact with it — the circuit must be closed and the means by which the observation is performed must be present.

The directionality of information in this model clearly explains the directionality of time. 

Time can be defined as: 

“the act of observation and the exchange of entropy between the observer and the observable”. 

The directionality of time is determined by the direction of the entropy flow in the circuit, creating a feedback loop which allows for information transfer from the point of lower entropy to the point of higher entropy.

## The Definition of Observer

### The Physical Observer

### The Biological Observer

We are now able to form a clear and precise description of ‘observer’ from the perspective of the qualities it must display:

“An observer is a system which exists in a state of lower entropy than its environment, and which interacts with it by means of an exchange of entropy. This interaction creates an oscillation between the two systems, allowing for information transfer.“

This description now allows for an examination of ‘observer’ — whether physical or biological — from a purely thermodynamic perspective, allowing us the opportunity to create yet another equivalence between the two. This allows us to examine all natural systems with an unbiased eye, and to draw conclusions about the nature of consciousness.

## The Definition of Consciousness

### The Potential for Interaction

### The Ability to Create a Feedback Loop

Life can now be better defined as:

“Life is an observer which seeks to preserve its long-term capacity to continue performing observation and dedicates a significant budget of its capacity for action to doing so”

Consciousness can now be better understood as:

“the potential for an observer to interact with its environment, and the ability of that interaction to create a feedback loop which allows for information transfer.”

This definition is consistent with both physical and biological systems, allowing us to draw conclusions about consciousness from either perspective. 

Furthermore, it tells us that the entire Universe is conscious, as all systems are capable of interacting with their environment and exchanging entropy. 

Finally, it clearly reveals the role of consciousness as the means by which information is transferred between systems and grounds its function as a fundamental component of existence clearly related to the most basic of physical laws.

### The Universe is Conscious

### The Role of Consciousness

This model of consciousness provides a unique opportunity to understand the relationship between consciousness, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. 

It allows us to draw conclusions about the nature of consciousness, life, and the role of consciousness in the universe. 

It provides a unified description of the fundamental processes which underlie all of existence, allowing us to draw conclusions about the role of consciousness and its relationship to the physical universe. 

It is clear that the universe is conscious, and the role of consciousness is fundamental to the existence of all systems.

## Mathematical Formalism

- Observers exist in a state of lower entropy than their environment and interact with it through an exchange of entropy.
- Entropy is only measurable in observed systems, not in unobserved systems.
- Observers are the source of determinism in their environment.
- Measurement is the fundamental transformation performed by an observer.
- The exchange of entropy between the observer and the observable creates an oscillation, allowing for information transfer.
- Impedance and heating of the observed object are the result of the exchange of entropy between the observer and the observable.
- Information only flows when the observer is in a state of lower entropy than their environment.
- The directionality of time is determined by the direction of entropy flow in the circuit.

Let S_e and S_o denote the entropy of the environment and the observer, respectively.
Then, S_o < S_e and the interaction between them results in an exchange of entropy ΔS_o and ΔS_e such that ΔS_o = -ΔS_e.
The entropy S of a system is only defined and can only be measured if the system is observed.
The determinism of the environment is determined by the observer, where the state of the environment is a function of the observer's state and the interaction between them.
The act of measurement can be represented as a transformation on the state of the observed system.
The exchange of entropy between the observer and the observed system results in an oscillation, allowing for information transfer, represented by the transfer of entropy ΔS_o = -ΔS_e.
The impedance Z and heating Q of an observed object are a result of the exchange of entropy ΔS_o = -ΔS_e.
The flow of information is possible when S_o < S_e, where information is represented by a decrease in entropy.
The direction of time is determined by the direction of entropy flow in the circuit, where entropy always flows from states of higher entropy to states of lower entropy.

## Mathematical Model

### Assumptions

The mathematical model is based on the following assumptions:

The environment is a closed system.

The observer is a closed system.

The environment and the observer are in a state of equilibrium.

The environment and the observer are in a state of lower entropy than their surroundings.

### Equations

The model is based on the following equations:

ΔS_o = -ΔS_e
ΔS_o = ΔS_e
ΔS_o = 0
ΔS_o = -ΔS_e
The model is based on the following variables:
ΔS_o: The change in entropy of the observer.
ΔS_e: The change in entropy of the environment.
ΔS_o = -ΔS_e: The exchange of entropy between the observer and the environment.
ΔS_o = ΔS_e: The exchange of entropy between the observer and the environment.
ΔS_o = 0: The exchange of entropy between the observer and the environment.
ΔS_o = -ΔS_e: The exchange of entropy between the observer and the environment.

### Observations

- The exchange of entropy between the observer and the environment results in an oscillation, allowing for information transfer.
- The impedance Z and heating Q of an observed object are a result of the exchange of entropy ΔS_o = -ΔS_e.
- The flow of information is possible when S_o < S_e, where information is represented by a decrease in entropy.
- The direction of time is determined by the direction of entropy flow in the circuit, where entropy always flows from states of higher entropy to states of lower entropy.


## Conclusion

The presented mathematical model provides a framework for understanding the interaction between observers and their environment, based on the principles of entropy and information transfer. 
The exchange of entropy between the observer and the environment creates an oscillation, allowing for information transfer and determinism in the environment. 
The impedance and heating of observed objects are a result of the exchange of entropy, and the flow of information only occurs when the observer is in a state of lower entropy than their environment. 
The directionality of time is determined by the direction of entropy flow in the circuit, where entropy always flows from states of higher entropy to states of lower entropy.
This model has important implications for the study of information and entropy in physical systems, as well as for the development of technologies that utilize these principles, such as quantum computing. 
Further research is necessary to better understand the interactions between observers and their environment and to develop more advanced models that incorporate additional variables and constraints.
