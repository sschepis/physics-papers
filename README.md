A repository of my main works on physics. Discusses Observational Equivalence, thermodynamics, observation, entropy, life, consciousness, and other physics topics

## The Circuit of Observation

I present a mathematical framework for modeling the active role of observers in perception and interaction across systems. The “circuit of observation” represents the flow of potential energy and information between an observer and its environment.

## The Quantum Chinese Room

I reframe the Chinese Room thought experiment to show that the Chinese Room actually shows that sentience is a property of systems with certain types of restricted information flow, and that the Chinese Room room is actually a structure which maintains a state of long-term superposition relative to its environment due to how its communication with its environment is structured.

## Bollzmann Entropy Formula

This paper presents the Boltzmann entropy formula, which states that the entropy of a system is proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates that correspond to a particular macrostate. This formula is based on the idea that entropy is a measure of the number of possible arrangements of the particles in a system, and that the entropy of a system increases as the number of possible arrangements increases. This formula has been used to calculate the entropy of a system in various thermodynamic states, including ideal gases, solids, and liquids.

## Observational Equivalence

This paper presents the Principle of Observational Equivalence, the foundational principle employed to build the theories presented here. It states that if two systems are methematically equivalent, then those systems are functionally equivalent, and valid logical and mathematical inferences can be made using these equivalencies.

## Modeling the Observer and Environment

This paper describes a mathematical model for the observer and the environment, and the entropy exchange between them. It takes into account the internal energy, heat, and entropy of the observer and the environment, and provides a framework for analyzing their interactions and their effects on each other.

## The Nature of Observation, Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics

This paper presents a thermodynamic model of the observer. giving empirical definitions for observer, observation, and determinism.

## The Physics of Observation

This paper presents a mathematical foundation for a new physics of the observer, modeling the primary terms and actions mathematically.
