# physics-papers

A repository of my main works on physics. Discusses Observational Equivalence, thermodynamics, observation, entropy, life, consciousness, and other physics topics

## Observational Equivalence

This is the foundational principle I employ to build the theories presented here. It states that if two systems are mathematically identical and cannot be differentiated mathematically, then those systems are fundamentally equivalent, and valid inferences can be made using these equivalencies.

## The Nature of Observation, Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics

In this paper, I present a model of the observer and observation from a thermodynamics perspective. Called entrodynamics, this model defines the observer in thermodynamic terms, giving us empirical definitions for observer, observation, and determinism.

## The Physics of Observation

This paper presents a mathematical foundation for Entrodynamics, modeling the primary terms and actions mathematically.
